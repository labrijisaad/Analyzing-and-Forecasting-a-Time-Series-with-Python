- 🎯 The main objective of this project was to study a time series to approach and manipulate abstract notions that we have seen during the course on time series class. Among the things we did in this project: `the decomposition of the series`, `the study of each component`, `the stationarity test`, `the choice of the degree of the model`, `the learning of the latter and the forecast of future values`, and much more...
- 📈 This study was carried out using the `mathematical tools provided in Python` which makes this manipulation easy !
